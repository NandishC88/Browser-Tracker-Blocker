# Browser-Tracker-Blocker
Many websites use hidden tracking scripts to collect user data like browsing habits and clicks, mainly for ads and analytics.  This project creates a browser extension that **finds and blocks tracking websites** automatically. It also shows how many trackers were blocked so the user can stay aware and protect their privacy.
